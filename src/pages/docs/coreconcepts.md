After you've installed `fleek`, open a terminal window and run `fleek init`.

```shell
fleek init
```

{% callout type="note" title="Don't Be Scared" %}
`fleek` will prompt you for your email address and your name for your configuration. This isn't because `fleek` is going to email you, it's because `git` requires a name and email address to commit changes.

{% /callout %}

This will create your configuration file and symlink it to `$HOME/.fleek.yml`. Open it with your favorite editor and take a look.
