Fleek has only one dependency: [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

## Prerequisites

### Install Nix

We love the [Determinate Systems Installer](https://zero-to-nix.com/), but any `nix` installer is good. If you're on Fedora Silverblue, [this script](https://github.com/dnkmmr69420/nix-installer-scripts/blob/main/installer-scripts/silverblue-nix-installer.sh) is the good stuff.

### Enable Flakes

After Nix is installed you need to enable [flakes and the nix command](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes). It can be as simple as this:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

## Bootstrap Fleek

Rather than downloading and installing Fleek, we're going to use the power of `nix` to run it directly from GitHub. This will let Fleek manage itself, and you'll always have the latest version.

First let's bootstrap `fleek`:

```shell
nix run github:ublue-os/fleek -- init
```

This will create your configuration file and symlink it to `$HOME/.fleek.yml`. Open it with your favorite editor and take a look.

Make any changes to the `~/.fleek.yml` file you want... we recommend Bling Level `high` for the best experience.  

Now let's apply your configuration:

```shell
nix run github:ublue-os/fleek -- apply
```
It will take a bit to download and install everything, but when it's done you should see something like this:
       
```shell
... more text above this ...
Activating onFilesChange
Activating reloadSystemd
 [âœ“]  Operation completed successfully
```

{% callout type="warning" title="Possible Errors: Existing Files" %}
You might see an error telling you that the installation failed because a file already exists. Fleek will create new shell configuration files for you, but it won't overwrite existing ones. You'll need to move or delete the existing files before Fleek can install the new ones. Try `mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak` (substituting the appropriate file names) and then run the apply command again.

{% /callout %}


*What happened here?* We just installed Nix Home Manager, configured it with your preferences, and applied it to your system. Note that up until this point you haven't even installed Fleek. The power of `nix` did it for you. 

You may need to close and re-open your terminal or even log out to see the changes.


## Deprecated Installation Options

These options are deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Fleek is now self-managing and should be installed with the bootstrap instructions above.

### Nix Profile (Deprecated)

You can install Fleek to your default nix profile with this command:

```bash
nix profile install github:ublue-os/fleek/main
```

This will add Fleek to your default nix profile (don't worry if you don't know what this means yet), which will be available in your $PATH.

### GitHub Releases (Deprecated)

You can also download fleek from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ublue-os/fleek/releases) link and move it somewhere in your $PATH.

The gzip'd tarball contains a binary, `fleek`, a `man` directory, and a `completions` directory. You can skip the `man` and `completions` directories if you don't need them.

Be sure to move `fleek` to somewhere in your $PATH. If you're not sure where that is, try `echo $PATH` to see what directories are in your path.

### Homebrew (Deprecated)

If you have Homebrew installed, you can use the Fleek tap:

```shell
brew tap ublue-os/homebrew-tap
brew install fleek
 ```
