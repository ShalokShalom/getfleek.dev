Fleek's `bling` level lets you choose how much sparkle gets added to your $HOME. Each level adds a few more applications and configuration options.

## Levels

There are four levels of `bling`: `none`, `low`, `default`, and `high`. The `none` level is the bare minimum, and the `high` level is the most bling you can get. The applications installed at each level are listed below.
