Fleek makes nix friendly

### Synopsis

Fleek installs and manages packages in your nix installation with a friendly and approachable config file.
Fleek uses the power of `nix` and `home-manager` behind the scenes to give you access to the largest repository of packages in the world.

Fleek hides the complexity of `nix` by giving you a CLI and YAML file to manage your installed applications.

To get started, try `fleek init`.

```shell
fleek [flags]
```

### Options

```shell
  -h, --help      help for fleek
  -q, --quiet     suppress logs
  -v, --verbose   show more detailed output
```
