# fleek

## Usage
> Fleek makes nix friendly

```shell
fleek
```

## Description


Fleek installs and manages packages in your nix installation with a friendly and approachable config file.
Fleek uses the power of `nix` and `home-manager` behind the scenes to give you access to the largest repository of packages in the world.

Fleek hides the complexity of `nix` by giving you a CLI and YAML file to manage your installed applications.

To get started, try `fleek init`.

To share configurations with other computers, see https://getfleek.dev/docs/multiple
