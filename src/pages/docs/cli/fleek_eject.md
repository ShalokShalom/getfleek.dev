## fleek eject

Manage your home configuration directly, without the .fleek.yml file.

### Synopsis

Eject writes your current configuration to disk and removes Fleek's templates.
Changes to .fleek.yml will be ignored; you will modify your Nix configurations directly.

```shell
fleek eject [flags]
```

### Options

```shell
  -h, --help   help for eject
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```shell
  -q, --quiet     suppress logs
  -v, --verbose   show more detailed output
```
